# Data Structures â€“ Course Projects

This repository includes my code from a Data Structures course, where I learned how to build and work with different kinds of data structures from scratch.

Each project helped me better understand how memory, logic, and performance come together when organizing and storing data efficiently.

### ðŸ§± Topics Covered

- Arrays and Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Hash Tables
- Sorting and Searching algorithms
- Recursion and Iteration
- Custom implementations without built-in libraries

### ðŸ’¡ Why I Made This

These projects were part of my learning process, and each one shows the progress I made in writing better, more structured, and more efficient code.
